  <section>
    <p>“How much cash do we really have today?”</p>
    <p>If you can’t answer that with confidence and in seconds, your treasury process is lagging behind.</p>

    <p>Legacy treasury teams rely on next-day bank statements, spreadsheets, and siloed data. But volatility, multi-currency operations, and working capital cycles demand real-time intelligence — and that’s where AI is changing the game.</p>

    <h2>1. Why Cash Visibility Matters More Than Ever</h2>
    <p>In 2025, companies face daily liquidity pressures: delayed receivables, FX devaluation, and rising interest costs. Without up-to-date cash forecasting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🛑 You might borrow when you don’t need to</li>
      <li>🛑 You might miss short-term investment windows</li>
      <li>🛑 You might fail to cover payroll on time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What AI Enables in Modern Treasury</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>📊 Bank account aggregation across regions in real-time</li>
      <li>🔄 Automated cash positioning with daily cash balances</li>
      <li>📈 Predictive cash flow modeling (13-week rolling forecast with AI)</li>
      <li>🚦 Smart alerts for liquidity gaps or idle balances</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Platforms like Kyriba, TIS, and TreasuryXpress now include AI modules that forecast inflows and outflows based on pattern recognition — not just static Excel rows.</p>

    <h2>3. Power BI + Open Banking Integration</h2>
    <p>Power BI can visualize global cash balances and treasury KPIs when integrated with APIs or automation platforms like Azure Logic Apps or Tableau Prep.</p>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Live dashboards with FX-adjusted cash by entity</li>
      <li>Historical trend analysis for liquidity gaps</li>
      <li>AI-generated cash burn forecasts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. ChatGPT’s Role in Treasury Insight</h2>
    <p>While ChatGPT can’t connect to banks, it helps explain trends, build policies, and automate narrative reports. Examples:</p>
    <blockquote><em>“Summarize the impact of a 5% EGP devaluation on our USD working capital.”</em></blockquote>
    <blockquote><em>“Draft a treasury policy for cash buffer thresholds across 3 regions.”</em></blockquote>

    <p>AI helps CFOs create board-ready narratives in less time and with more clarity.</p>

    <h2>5. What to Watch For</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>⚠️ API banking integrations can be inconsistent</li>
      <li>⚠️ Not all platforms provide true real-time syncs</li>
      <li>⚠️ AI forecasts need finance review before action</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Don’t automate trust. Use AI to advise, not control, treasury moves.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: Know Your Cash. Now.</h2>
    <p>AI gives CFOs the clarity and agility to manage cash proactively, not reactively. In volatile markets, that’s the difference between scaling and stalling.</p>
