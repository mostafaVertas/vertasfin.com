    <h2>What Is Gross Margin?</h2>
    <p>Gross margin is the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It reflects how efficiently your company produces or delivers its products or services. The formula is simple:</p>
    <p><strong>Gross Margin (%) = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue × 100</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Why It’s More Than a Metric</h2>
    <p>Too often, gross margin is viewed as just a line item. In reality, it is a vital strategic signal. A healthy gross margin allows your business to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cover fixed operating costs and still invest in growth</li>
      <li>Absorb pricing shocks (inflation, supply issues)</li>
      <li>Fund marketing, R&D, or technology initiatives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
    <p>Company A and Company B both generate $10M in annual sales. But Company A has a gross margin of 25%, while Company B operates at 50%. That means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Company A has $2.5M to cover all other expenses</li>
      <li>Company B has $5M — double the flexibility and profit potential</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The takeaway? Gross margin is not just about profitability — it's about breathing room and growth potential.</p>

    <h2>Strategic Decisions Powered by Gross Margin</h2>
    <p>Understanding your gross margin can guide multiple areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pricing Strategy:</strong> Adjust prices while protecting competitiveness</li>
      <li><strong>Product Mix:</strong> Focus on high-margin offerings</li>
      <li><strong>Cost Control:</strong> Identify operational inefficiencies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benchmarking Matters</h2>
    <p>Don’t evaluate your margin in a vacuum. Compare against industry peers and historical performance. For example, a 30% margin might be excellent in retail but weak in SaaS.</p>
