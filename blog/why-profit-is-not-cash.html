    <h1>Profit Looks Fine. So Why Are We Out of Cash?</h1>

    <p>It’s one of the most frustrating moments in finance:</p>
    <blockquote><strong>“Our P&L shows a profit… but the bank account is dry.”</strong></blockquote>

    <p>Many business owners and CFOs in the Middle East have lived this moment — especially in fast-growing or import-heavy environments. This article explains the disconnect between profit and cash, shows how to diagnose it, and provides tools to prevent it from derailing your strategy.</p>

    <h2>📌 The Root Problem — Profit ≠ Cash</h2>
    <p>Profit is an accounting measure. Cash is a real-world constraint. The income statement may look great, but if receivables aren’t collected, inventory is bloated, or supplier terms have shifted, cash can vanish quickly — without ever showing up as a “loss.”</p>

    <p>Let’s start with a basic example:</p>
    <pre><code>
    Revenue:       10,000,000 USD
    COGS:          (6,000,000) USD
    Net Profit:     1,200,000 USD (after expenses)
    </code></pre>
    <p>But if AR rose by 2,000,000 USD and inventory increased by 1,000,000 USD… your **cash flow is negative**, even though you show a 1.2M profit.</p>

    <h2>🧠 5 Common Reasons Why This Happens</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Slow Collections (High DSO):</strong> Your revenue is on paper, but cash hasn’t arrived. Common in Egypt, UAE, and Saudi B2B contracts.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory Absorption:</strong> Your profits are sitting in stock. Many growing firms in FMCG and distribution suffer here.</li>
      <li><strong>CAPEX Overload:</strong> Big equipment purchases don’t show on P&L, but drain bank balances fast.</li>
      <li><strong>FX or Subsidy Losses:</strong> USD/TRY devaluation eats away at supplier payments or margin, silently eroding cash.</li>
      <li><strong>Unpaid Taxes or Dividends:</strong> Deferred obligations come due suddenly, shrinking working capital.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>💡 <strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t have a rolling 13-week cash forecast, you won’t see this in time.</p>

    <h2>🧾 How to Diagnose the Problem (With Data)</h2>

    <p>Here’s what your finance team should check weekly:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cash Conversion Cycle:</strong> DSO + DIO - DPO</li>
      <li><strong>Working Capital Trend:</strong> Change in (AR + Inventory - AP)</li>
      <li><strong>Receivables Aging Report:</strong> % of receivables > 90 days</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory Coverage Ratio:</strong> Inventory ÷ Average Monthly COGS</li>
      <li><strong>FX Losses and Non-Operating Adjustments:</strong> Check in ERP cash flow report (indirect method)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>📉 If any of the above trends rise while EBITDA is stable, you are leaking cash — quietly.</p>

    <h2>🛠️ What Reports You Need (and What to Change)</h2>

    <p>Most accounting systems hide these risks in “net working capital.” But here’s how to fix that:</p>

    <h3>✅ Build These Reports:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rolling Working Capital Report:</strong> Weekly change in AR, Inventory, and AP</li>
      <li><strong>Cash Bridge from EBITDA to Net Cash:</strong> Shows where profit turns into (or doesn’t) cash</li>
      <li><strong>CAPEX Tracker:</strong> Monthly planned vs actual + cash availability</li>
      <li><strong>Collections Tracker:</strong> By client, by aging bucket, with escalation logic</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>💡 Recommended Tools:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Power BI for trend dashboards</li>
      <li>Excel with ERP-linked queries for cash bridge automation</li>
      <li>ERP add-ons (Odoo, SAP, Oracle) for cash forecasting modules</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📊 Case Study – “Why a $5M Net Profit Still Meant Cash Crisis”</h2>

    <p>A UAE construction firm had just posted 5M AED in net profit. But the owner was preparing to borrow at 12% interest to make payroll.</p>

    <p>Our diagnosis revealed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Receivables up by 9M AED (90-day payment terms with 120-day actual)</li>
      <li>Advance inventory for 3 new projects — not reimbursed yet</li>
      <li>Deferred supplier payments due within 15 days</li>
    </ul>

    <p>💥 In 3 weeks, the company recovered 4.5M in overdue receivables, postponed 2.1M in supplier payments, and implemented a weekly working capital dashboard.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>“We had the data — we just weren’t looking at it the right way.”</em>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🔚 Conclusion: Profit Is a Story. Cash Is Reality.</h2>

    <p>If your income statement looks great but you feel stress in the treasury — trust the cash. The disconnect is real, and it’s fixable with the right reports, habits, and reviews.</p>
